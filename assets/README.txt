Save the supplied logo image here as `logo.png` or `logo.svg`.
Recommended filename: logo.png
Path: assets/logo.png

If you want the favicon to match, save a 48x48 or 32x32 PNG as `assets/favicon.png` or an .ico file at the project root named `favicon.ico`.

Notes:
- The site styles expect `assets/logo.png` and will display the image in the header.
- If you want a different size, edit `styles.css` .logo img height (currently 48px).
